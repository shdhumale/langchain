# langchain
This repo contain simple example of langchain with python using Google Gemini LLM

It appears you're referring to a personal GitHub repository for `langchain` by `shdhumale` ([https://github.com/shdhumale/langchain.git](https://github.com/shdhumale/langchain.git)). Since this is a personal repository, a detailed `README.md` would typically depend on the specific projects and examples you've included within it.

However, I can provide a comprehensive `README.md` template that you can adapt for your `shdhumale/langchain` project, assuming it contains various LangChain-related experiments, learning modules, or applications.

# LangChain Experiments and Applications

This repository serves as a personal collection of experiments, learning modules, and mini-applications built using the [LangChain framework](https://www.langchain.com/). It's a space for exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how LangChain can be used to chain them together with other tools and data sources to create powerful, context-aware, and intelligent applications.

## About LangChain

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a standard interface for connecting LLMs with external data sources and computational capabilities, enabling the creation of complex applications such as:

  - **Chatbots:** Building conversational AI agents that can maintain context.
  - **Question Answering:** Retrieving and synthesizing information from documents or knowledge bases.
  - **Data Analysis:** Using LLMs to understand and extract insights from unstructured data.
  - **Agents:** Giving LLMs the ability to decide which actions to take, observe results, and repeat until a task is complete.

## Project Overview

This repository is where I document my journey and learnings with LangChain. It contains various individual projects or code snippets demonstrating different aspects of LangChain, from basic chains to more complex agentic workflows and integrations with vector databases, external APIs, etc.

The goal is to:

  - Learn and experiment with various LangChain components.
  - Implement practical use cases for LLMs.
  - Share code examples and insights.
  - Provide a personal reference for LangChain development.

## Features

  - **Modular Examples:** Each example or module is self-contained and focuses on a specific LangChain concept or use case.
  - **Clear Documentation (within examples):** Code is well-commented, and explanations are provided for each example's purpose and functionality.
  - **Easy to Run:** Examples are designed to be easy to set up and run locally.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.9+ (or as required by specific LangChain examples)
  - `pip` (Python package installer)

You will likely also need API keys for various LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic) or other services (e.g., vector databases like Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS, or search APIs like Tavily, Serper) depending on the examples you wish to run.
**It is highly recommended to set these API keys as environment variables.**

For example:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key"
# ... and so on for other services
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shdhumale/langchain.git
    cd langchain
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the necessary Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: You might need to generate or update `requirements.txt` as you add new dependencies to your individual projects.)*
    Alternatively, for a general LangChain setup:

    ```bash
    pip install langchain langchain-openai # Add other integrations as needed
    ```

### Running Examples

Each example or module will have its own instructions within its respective directory. Generally, you would navigate to the specific example's folder and run the Python script.

For instance:

```bash
cd examples/basic_chain
python basic_qa.py
```

*(Please replace `examples/basic_chain` and `basic_qa.py` with the actual paths and file names from your repository.)*
